## 📝 Syntax Guide (語法指南)

### 1. Scene Headings (場景)
Start a line with standard screenplay prefixes. They will automatically bold.
*   **Syntax**: `INT.`, `EXT.`, `INT./EXT.`, `I/E.`, or start a line with a period `.` to force a scene heading.

    ```
    INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
    ```

### 2. Characters (角色識別)
*   **A. Explicit Marker (顯式標記)**: Prefix with `@`.
    *   `@JORDAN`, `@娟秀`
    *   *(The `@` symbol is automatically hidden in Live Preview and Reading Mode)*
*   **B. Colon Suffix (冒號)**: Character name followed by a colon (`:` or `：`).
    *   `娟秀：肚子餓了。` -> Centered name, dialogue below.
    *   `ALEX: Hello.` -> Works for all languages.
*   **C. ALL CAPS English (全大寫英文)**:
    *   `JORDAN`, `GUARD 1`
    *   *(Note: Must contain at least one letter A-Z to prevent pure numbers/dates from being misidentified)*

### 3. Dialogue (對白)
Any line immediately following a Character, Parenthetical, or another Dialogue line is treated as Dialogue (indented).

    @JOKER
    Why so serious?
    (smiling)
    Let's put a smile on that face.

    *(The lines following the character automatically become dialogue format)*

### 4. Parentheticals / Extensions (旁白/情緒/畫外音)
Use parentheses `()` `（）` or standard prefixes `VO:` / `OS:`. They will be centered and italicized.
*   **Syntax**: `(emotion)`, `VO: Text`, `OS: Text`

    ```
    @BATMAN
    (struggling)
    Where is she?
    
    OS: It's too late.
    ```
    *(Note: `OS:` / `VO:` lines are treated as parentheticals and center aligned)*

### 5. Transitions (轉場)
Standard uppercase transitions ending in `TO:` or start/end keywords. They will be right-aligned.
*   **Syntax**: `CUT TO:`, `FADE IN:`, `FADE OUT.`, `DISSOLVE TO:`
